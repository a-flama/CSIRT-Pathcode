# CSIRT-Pathcode

## In this project.. I learned how to:
- Simulate a cybersecurity analyst role within a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to investigate a malware attack.
- Utilize Splunk to analyze authentication data, anti-virus logs, and other relevant information to uncover incident details.
- Document findings, artifacts (e.g., malware hash), and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in Catalyst, including notes from external sources like VirusTotal.
